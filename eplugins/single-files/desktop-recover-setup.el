;;; Commentary:

;;; This is an example of one way of using the code from the
;;; desktop-recover project.

;;; To use this place this file (and it's relatives) in your load-path,
;;; and add the line:
;;;
;;;    (load-library "desktop-recover-setup")
;;;
;;; to one of your emacs init files (e.g. ~/.emacs).

(provide 'desktop-recover-setup)
(eval-when-compile
  (require 'cl))

;; Something like this is recommended to get emacs to shut-up
;; and never ask you for a coding system.  Otherwise this can
;; happen on *every* desktop-save triggered by the auto-save-hook:
(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)

(load-library "desktop-recover") ;; this indirectly loads desktop.el

;; ;; Optional, defaults to "$HOME/.emacs.d"
;;  (setq desktop-recover-location
;;        (desktop-recover-fixdir "$HOME/.emacs.d/"))
;; ;; Myself, I set this from a wrapper I use to launch
;; ;; different emacsen set-up for different purposes (gnus, mh-e, etc)

;; And this brings up the interactive buffer restore menu
  (desktop-recover-interactive)
